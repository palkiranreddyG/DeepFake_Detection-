# Deepfake Detection Model

This project presents a Deep Learning-based Deepfake Detection System that identifies manipulated videos and images using facial pattern analysis. Built using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Scikit-learn, the model is trained on real and fake face datasets to accurately classify visual content as genuine or fabricated.

## Features

* Detects deepfake images and videos using facial inconsistencies
* Utilizes CNN-based model architecture with TensorFlow/Keras
* Processes media frames using OpenCV
* Provides binary classification: Real or Fake
* Command-line and future web integration supported

## Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **TensorFlow/Keras**
* **OpenCV**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **NumPy, Pandas**

## How It Works

1. Input image or video is preprocessed to extract facial features
2. Model analyzes key facial regions for tampering signs
3. A classification is returned: `REAL` or `FAKE`

## Dataset

* Based on publicly available datasets like **FaceForensics++** or **DeepFakeDetection** (as applicable)
* Contains labeled real and fake samples for training and testing

## Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepfake-detection.git
cd deepfake-detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run detection on an image
python predict.py --input sample.jpg
```

## Future Work

* Integrate with a user-friendly web interface
* Expand to live video feed analysis
* Improve accuracy with more advanced architectures
